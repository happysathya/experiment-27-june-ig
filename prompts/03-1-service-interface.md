# Prompt 3.1: Service Interface

```
Create a service interface following hexagonal architecture principles:

File: src/main/java/com/ig/service/HealthService.java

Requirements:
- Package: com.ig.service
- Interface name: HealthService
- Method: getHealthStatus() that returns HealthResponse
- Import the HealthResponse record from com.ig.dto package
- Follow clean architecture principles - this interface represents the business logic contract

Do not implement the interface yet, only define the contract.
