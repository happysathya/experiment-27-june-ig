# Prompt 1.1: Project Structure Setup

```
Create a Maven project structure for a Spring Boot application with the following requirements:

Project Details:
- Group ID: com.ig
- Artifact ID: client-service
- Package structure: com.ig

Create the following directory structure:
- client-service/ (root directory)
- src/main/java/com/ig/ (main source directory)
- src/test/java/com/ig/ (test source directory)

Only create the directory structure and ensure it follows Maven conventions. Do not create any Java files yet.
