# Prompt 4.1: Controller Class Setup

```
Create the REST controller class with basic setup:

File: src/main/java/com/ig/controller/HealthController.java

Requirements:
- Package: com.ig.controller
- Class name: HealthController
- Add @RestController annotation
- Add @RequestMapping("/api") for base path
- Add constructor for dependency injection of HealthService
- Import necessary Spring annotations and HealthService interface

Do not implement any endpoints yet, just set up the controller structure with proper dependency injection.
